```

### Environment Configuration
- ✅ Environment files configured (`.env`, `.env.local`)
- ✅ API routes functional
- ✅ Static assets optimized

## Remaining ESLint Warnings (Non-Critical)

These warnings don't prevent deployment but can be addressed in future iterations:

### Unused Variables/Imports
- Test files: Some unused imports in test files
- Service files: Some unused variables in mock data generation
- Component files: Some unused utility functions

### Next.js Recommendations
- Avatar component: Using `<img>` instead of `next/image` (suppressed with eslint-disable)

## Deployment Commands

### For Production Deployment:
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Or deploy to your preferred platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### For Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Platform-Specific Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Environment variables will be automatically detected
3. Deploy with zero configuration

### Other Platforms
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is available
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Start with `npm run start`
4. Serve on port 3000 or configure PORT environment variable

## Performance Metrics
- **First Load JS**: 99.6 kB (excellent)
- **Main Page Size**: 72.6 kB (good)
- **API Routes**: Lightweight at 131 B each

## Security & Best Practices ✅
- Environment variables properly configured
- API routes secured
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configured for code quality
